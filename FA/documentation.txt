The program reads data from the file
File structure (EBNF) 

STATES = <set of states, comma separated>
ALPHABET = <comma separated values>
INITIAL_STATE = <one state>
FINAL_STATES = <set of final states, comma separated>
TRANSITIONS = < list of  (state, symbol) -> other_state, seaparated by line

After it read the data from the file, the code is able to validate a given word by starting from the initial state
and trying to find a transtion containing the required symbol. It will continue with the current_state as initial state. 
if it encounters a non valid symbol (there is no transition from curent state to another, passing trought the required symbol), 
will return false, otherwise will continue


Input files identifiers.in and integers.in serve as FA for checking grammar of identifiers and integers
