Grammar 

- contains 4 main fields that are parsed from file 
- set of non terminals
- set of terminals 
- starting symbol
- productions 

in the file, non terminals are all on one line, separated by space, are read like so and added into the set 
set of terminals is expected and read in the same way 
starting symbol is one, one one line 
productions follow the format 
  non_terminal -> list_of_tokens separated by space
  or 
  non_terminal -> list_of_token | other_list_of_token 

production is a map, with key the non_terminal and as values a vector of vector of string 
      a list of tokens is kept as a vector of strings
  the main vector holds all the list of tokens 

Recursive Descendant parser
is done by implementing expand, advance, momentary insuccess, back, another try, success

expand function gets the item from the top of the stack, checks if is a non terminal and than proceed to add into the stack the first available production 
the advance function checks if the top of the stack is the same simbol with the element at index of the input string 
if the advance cannot be made, it means that the production used in not valid, so the momentaryInsuccess function is called 
it will get the next available production of that 





the back function pops the last production from the stack, also removing it from the list of used productions 
if the back function cannot find another valid production 
it will go back one more step
